# Cloud Workstations Config
This folder contains configurations for working with Google Cloud Workstations.

The GCP project `doradotdev` hosts a Workstations cluster that we can use. In this folder, we can host configs like Dockerfiles for custom workstation images. [Here's some documentation](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/customize-container-images) about that.

TODO: #2 per those docs, we should "set up a [secure pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/software-supply-chain-security/docs/create-secure-image-pipeline) to automatically rebuild these images when the Cloud Workstations base image is updated"
